Monday 6.3

Haven't done much yet, but made GameApp.scala in order to start making the GUI. Aadded some dependencies and tried out ScalaFX with that.
Also got this warning with ScalaFX:
WARNING: Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @6a2bf0ca',
but after some research it seems like it can be ignored.
Probably spent about 5 hours so far as I also fixed some problems regarding coding environment.
I'm definitely lagging a bit behind my schedule but since I spent a fair amount of time last week on other courses I have more time to focus on the project this week.
