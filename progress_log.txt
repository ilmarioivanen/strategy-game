Monday 6.3

Haven't done much yet, but made GameApp.scala in order to start making the GUI. Aadded some dependencies and tried out ScalaFX with that.
Also got this warning with ScalaFX:
WARNING: Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @6a2bf0ca',
but after some research it seems like it can be ignored.
Probably spent about 5 hours so far as I also fixed some problems regarding coding environment.
I'm definitely lagging a bit behind my schedule but since I spent a fair amount of time last week on other courses I have more time to focus on the project this week.


Monday 20.3

Unfortunately due to work and some unexpected life circumstances I was not able to work on the project at all during the last two weeks.
I'm now greatly behind schedule but I'm confident that I manage to finish the project in time. I probably won't have much time for polishing
and I'll have to maybe cut some gameplay ideas but that's fine.


Monday 3.4

This time I finally got something done. I made the first proper version of the user interface with buttons and started implementing some other classes.
I probably spent 10 hours at most but still made nice progress.
I don't have almost any other schoolwork until the deadline so I'm not too stressed.


Monday 17.4

Most of the base game is completed and works fine. Some functionalities are missing, but otherwise I only need to add more content.
I haven't done much testing outside of using println() which is probably not ideal but it worked well enough.
I probably spent 60+ hours the last two weeks, and I'd say I need at least 20 hours more to complete the game without much polishing.
Things to do:
  - update the AI decision making (currently random)
  - saving/loading the game and save file management
  - a few small gui functionalities
  - stage effects
  - more characters/skills/stages
  - proper testing
  - final document
If time:
  - simple animations
  - prettier sprites
  - cleaning up the code
Since I still have a week left I think I can finish the project in time.
